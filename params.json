I am learning game development (specifically Love2D) using [@josefnpat's](https://github.com/josefnpat) excellent [Love2D tutorial](http://cupm.net/public/love2dtutorial/). This game is Battlefield 1942 modeled on the game of the same name on GameBoy Color. I am simply adding [features](https://raw.github.com/hardikr/bf42/master/CHANGELOG.txt) to the original game in the tutorial.\r\n\r\n## Running the game\r\n\r\nAs of now, you need Love2D installed to play the game. I will publish a binary soon.\r\nGrab the [assets (7z)](http://cupm.net/public/love2dtutorial/1942gb_v1.0.7z), unzip `assets.zip` to the cloned folder, then:\r\n\r\n    love main.lua\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
